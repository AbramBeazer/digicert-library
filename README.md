# digicert-library

Coding Challenge

Using Java, write a minimal library API that can perform the following functions:

* List all books in the library
* CRUD operations on a single book

The application does not have to be fully functional, just have Abram spend around an hour or two and send it over as a link to a GitHub repo once it's completed. Thereâ€™s no restrictions on what resources he uses or third-party plugins that he can consider. The point is having fun with it and we look forward to seeing his results!
